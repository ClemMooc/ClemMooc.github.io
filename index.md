# Plot_ly is better than GGplot

## GGplot
When I learned about **GGplot** during my INFO 201 lecture, I found it to be extremely confusing.
To be honest, I hated the syntax of it, and how you had to stack all of these elements together to make a graph.
Maybe it's just me and how I work, but GGplot was extremely unintuitive.
GGplot was so unintuitive that I didn't even manage to finish the GGplot assignment that we had to complete.

## When I learned about Plot_ly
During my time working for the final group project. My colleague suggested that we use **Plot_ly** isntead of GGplot.
Curious about how this new package worked, I looked up Plot_ly on Google and found a really helpful [Plotly R page](https://plot.ly/r/).

This page is extremely helpful, showing real time charts, their code, and even showing variant charts with different chart features.
To me, this is the quintessential R package page, in which the content is helpful, the navigation is easy, and the code is intuitive.

This was **revolutionary** (or at least in a relative term to GGplot). Visuals were so much more easy to create, and with interactive elements, colors, and even different/unique types of charts.
We loved Plot_ly so much, our team made two charts on our Spotify Web Api, which impressed some of our audiences at the project fair.

## The Verdict
Plot_ly is a much better package the GGplot. I wish we had learned about it in the INFO 201 lectures, but I'm at least glad we got to utilize in our final project.
